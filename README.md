# Theme Manager

Save syntax and UI theme combinations (along with individual configurations for the UI theme!). This will also sync themes in collaboration with [sync-settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings).

## Saving Themes
Load the syntax and UI themes you want to save as a theme in the settings view. Then, type `save theme` into the command palette and hit enter which will prompt you to give a name to your new theme combination. Some UI themes are configurable and their unique configuration will be saved to your theme.

## Changing Themes
Type `change theme` into the command palette and select a theme you've previously saved.
